# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple calculator to compute **simple interest** given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

---

## Formula

The formula used is: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal × Rate × Time


Where:  
- `Principal` (p) is the initial amount of money.  
- `Rate` (r) is the annual interest rate (in decimal, e.g., 5% = 0.05).  
- `Time` (t) is the duration in years.

---

## Inputs

- `p` : Principal amount (e.g., 1000)  
- `r` : Annual interest rate (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)  
- `t` : Time period in years (e.g., 3)

---

## Output

- `SI` : Simple interest calculated using the formula above

---

## Example
Input:
p = 1000
r = 0.05
t = 3

Output:
SI = 1000 × 0.05 × 3 = 150

## How to Run

1. Open the program in your preferred programming environment.  
2. Enter the principal, rate, and time when prompted.  
3. The calculator will display the calculated simple interest.
